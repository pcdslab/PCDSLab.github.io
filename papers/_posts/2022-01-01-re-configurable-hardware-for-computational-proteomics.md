# Abstract

In 1984, when the world was introduced to the first-ever reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) device, it offered to solve a critical problem faced during the implementation of application specific integrated chips (ASIC). Even though FPGAs ran at a clock speed much slower than that of an ASIC, they provided an attractive solution to emulate the design logic and verify the functional and timing performance at the early stages of the design process.
