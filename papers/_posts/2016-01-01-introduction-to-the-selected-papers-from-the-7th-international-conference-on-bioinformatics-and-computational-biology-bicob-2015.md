# Abstract

In the past decade, the scientiŻc community has seen unprecedented increase in the volume and complexity of the biological data. Our data-generation capability will likely reach exponential bounds with the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and high-throughput mass spectrometers and continued decreasing cost of producing such data sets. In order to exploit the scientiŻc understanding of this vast ocean of biological data, the underlying information must be integrated, analyzed, displayed, and modeled in an eącient manner. However, the big data generated from these high-throughput technologies is becoming a hurdle in the system-wide analysis of biological entities. This special issue is a follow up to the 7th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BICoB-2015), which took place in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA during 9–11 March 2015. The guest editors …
