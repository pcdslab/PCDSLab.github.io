# Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects large number of children and adults in the US, and worldwide. Early and quick diagnosis of ASD can improve the quality of life significantly both for patients and their families. Prior research provides strong evidence that structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from individuals with ASD exhibit distinguishing characteristics that differ in local and global, spatial and temporal neural patterns of the brain – and therefore can be used for diagnostic purposes for various mental disorders. However, the data from MRI are high-dimensional and advanced methods are needed to make sense out of these datasets. In this paper, we present a novel model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) that can utilize resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data to classify ASD subjects from health controls (HC). In addition to using the graph from traditional correlation …
