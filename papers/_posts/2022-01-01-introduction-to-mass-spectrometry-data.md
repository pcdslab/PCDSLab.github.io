# Abstract

Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to elucidate the chemical structures of peptide molecules and has numerous systems biology applications [, , , , , , , , , , –]. Mass spectrometryMass spectrometry is also used in metabolomicsMetabolomics, glycomicsGlycomics, lipidomicsLipidomics and clinical applications [, , , , –].
