# Abstract

Scientific research is increasingly relying on complex workflows that span multiple computing paradigms, including high-performance computing (HPC), high-throughput computing (HTC), and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). Traditional monolithic computing infrastructures often struggle to accommodate these diverse and evolving demands. The Reconfigurable Advanced Platform for Transdisciplinary Open Research (RAPTOR) addresses this challenge by providing a dynamically reconfigurable computing environment that integrates with federated resources. RAPTOR's architecture enables dynamic provisioning between an HPC cluster and the Chameleon Cloud platform based on workload requirements, supporting bare-metal customization for specialized applications. This paper focuses on RAPTOR's reconfigurability features and demonstrates their effectiveness through quantitative performance evaluations across four scientific domains: computational proteomics, climate modeling, weather research, and hurricane risk assessment. Our results demonstrate that RAPTOR's reconfigurable design significantly enhances research productivity by providing an appropriate computing environment for diverse computational needs.
