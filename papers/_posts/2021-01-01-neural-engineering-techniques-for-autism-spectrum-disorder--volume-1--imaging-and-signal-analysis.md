# Abstract

Neural Engineering for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Volume One: Imaging and Signal Analysis Techniques presents the latest advances in neural engineering and biomedical engineering as applied to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Advances in the role of neuroimaging, infrared spectroscopy, sMRI, fMRI, DTI, social behaviors and suitable data analytics useful for clinical diagnosis and research applications for Autism Spectrum Disorder are covered, including relevant case studies. The application of brain signal evaluation, EEG analytics, feature selection, and analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals are presented for detection and estimation of the degree of ASD. Presents applications of Neural Engineering and other Machine Learning techniques for the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Includes in-depth technical coverage of imaging and signal analysis techniques, including coverage of functional MRI, neuroimaging, infrared spectroscopy, sMRI, fMRI, DTI, and neuroanatomy of autism Covers Signal Analysis for the detection and estimation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including brain signal analysis, EEG analytics, feature selection, and analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals for ASD Written to help engineers, computer scientists, researchers and clinicians understand the technology and applications of Neural Engineering for the detection and diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
