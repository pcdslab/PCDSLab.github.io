# Abstract

With the rapid increase in the volume of biological data generated using next generation technologies, designing algorithms to process these data in an eącient manner and gaining biological insight is becoming a signiŻcantly growing challenge. This special issue is a follow-up to the 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BICoB 2013) that took place in Honolulu, Hawaii during March 4–6, 2013. The guest editors selected a few top-quality papers from the BICoB proceedings and invited the authors of these papers to submit extended versions of their proceedings papers. After a rigorous review process the guest editors have selected the following Żve papers described below for publication in this special issue.The Żrst paper titled\Studying the role of APOE in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis using a systems biology model 1 presents one of the Żrst attempts to model AD from a systems approach to study physiologically relevant parameters that may prove useful in the future."
