# Abstract

Understanding dissolved organic matter (DOM) export to the ocean is needed to assess the impact of climate change on the global carbon cycle. The molecular-level characterization of DOM compositional variability and complexity in aquatic ecosystems has been analytically challenging. Advanced analytical studies based on ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) have proven highly successful to better understand the dynamics of DOM in coastal ecosystems. In this work, the molecular signature of DOM along a freshwater-to-estuarine gradient in the Harney River, Florida Everglades was analyzed for the first time using a novel approach based on tandem high resolution ion mobility and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-TIMS-FT ICR MS). This method enhances traditional DOM molecular characterization by including the molecular isomeric complexity. An average of six and up to 12 …
