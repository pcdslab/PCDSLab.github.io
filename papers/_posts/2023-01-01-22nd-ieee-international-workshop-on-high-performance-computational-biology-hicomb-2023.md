# Abstract

The size and complexity of genomic and biomedical big data continue to grow at a exponential pace, and the analysis of these complex, noisy, data sets demands efficient algorithms and high performance computing architectures. Hence, high-performance computing (HPC) has become an integral part of research and development in bioinformatics, computational biology, and medical and health informatics. The goal of the HiCOMB workshop is to showcase novel HPC research and technologies to solve data-and compute-intensive problems arising from all areas of computational life sciences. The workshop will feature contributed papers as well as invited talks from reputed researchers in the field.This year's program will feature a keynote talk by Valerie Scheider, from the Intramural research program at National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, and one invited talk by Daniel Jacobson, from Oak …
