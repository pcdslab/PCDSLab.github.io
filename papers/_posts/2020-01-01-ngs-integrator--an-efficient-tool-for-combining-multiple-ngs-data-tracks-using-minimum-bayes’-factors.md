# Abstract

Background Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used for genome-wide identification and quantification of DNA elements involved in the regulation of gene transcription. Studies that generate multiple high-throughput NGS datasets require data integration methods for two general tasks: 1) generation of genome-wide data tracks representing an aggregate of multiple replicates of the same experiment; and 2) combination of tracks from different experimental types that provide complementary information regarding the location of genomic features such as enhancers.   Results NGS-Integrator is a Java-based command line application, facilitating efficient integration of multiple genome-wide NGS datasets. NGS-Integrator first transforms all input data tracks using the complement of the minimum Bayes’ factor so that all values are expressed in the range [0,1] representing the probability of a true signal given the …
