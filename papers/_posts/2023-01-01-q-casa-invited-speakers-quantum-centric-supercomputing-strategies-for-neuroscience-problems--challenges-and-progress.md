# Abstract

For decades high-performance computing systems have allowed researchers, scientists and engineers to solve complex data- and compute-intensive problems. These parallel and distributed computing systems provided researchers to develop state of the art solutions in areas such as machine learning, health, and life science. While successful for a large number of problems, these systems face limitations when handling intractable problems which require either an enormous number of resources (i.e. number of bits, or power) or time to solve a problem (i.e. factoring integers). In this work we describe how quantum computers can enhance these systems by incorporating quantum computational principles to create a quantum-centric supercomputer. Recent developments include quantum middleware, error mitigation, and error suppression techniques to curtail these issues in near-term quantum devices and enable …
