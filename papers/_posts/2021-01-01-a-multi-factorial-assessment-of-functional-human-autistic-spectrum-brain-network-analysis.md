# Abstract

The variability of the results obtained by the statistical analysis of functional human brain networks depend on multiple factors such as: the source of the fMRI data, the brain parcellations, the graph theory measures, and the threshold values applied to the functional connectivity matrices to obtain adjacency matrices of sparse graphs. Therefore, the brain network used for down-stream analysis is heavily dependent on the methods that are applied to the fMRI data to obtain and analyze such networks. In this paper we present the preliminary results of a multi-factorial assessment of the statistical analysis of functional human brain networks. The assessment was performed in the functional human brain networks obtained from the resting state fMRI data of ten imaging sites provided by the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) preprocessed functional magnetic resonance database, with six different functional …
