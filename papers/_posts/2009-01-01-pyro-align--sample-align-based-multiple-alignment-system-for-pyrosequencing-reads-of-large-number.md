# Abstract

Pyro-Align is a multiple alignment program specifically designed for pyrosequencing reads of huge number. Multiple sequence alignment is shown to be NP-hard and heuristics are designed for approximate solutions. Multiple sequence alignment of pyrosequenceing reads is complex mainly because of 2 factors. One being the huge number of reads, making the use of traditional heuristics,that scale very poorly for large number, unsuitable. The second reason is that the alignment cannot be performed arbitrarily, because the position of the reads with respect to the original genome is important and has to be taken into account.In this report we present a short description of the multiple alignment system for pyrosequencing reads.
